• Handle respawn
Currently some mechanics in-place favor missions with respawn disabled. A killed traitor will simply respawn and continue killing everyone. The only way to truly get rid of him is to restrain him somewhere, which means the traitor will just need to wait the round out. Furthermore the 'survive' sub objective is trivial with respawning turned on.
However, disabling respawn can lead to very long 1on1 games and often results in people rather leaving than watching this play out. Therefore, to assure a crowded server, we need to enable some form of respawning.

Ideas of what could happen if a traitor dies:
    1. (Vanilla) Randomly select new traitor 
    2. Respawn as a monster
    3. Dead traitors will respawn as normal crew (implemented)
    4. Traitors spawn on another (small) assault submarine, maybe similar to legacy's infiltrator mode
 
• Expand persistent points (=XP) system
   • non-traitors gain points by completing main mission (implemented)
   • loose points on every death instead of end round (implemented)
   • gain temporary xp by time being alive? Or persistent points?
 
• Auto end round
   • on all players dead? (already possible by setting vanilla Auto-Restart)
   • on traitor won (implemented)
 
• Team balance
Since security officers can not be traitor, it may be a good idea to assure a certain number of securities depending on the total crew size.
